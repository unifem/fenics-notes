    "**Note on stability of finite element spaces for the Navier–Stokes equations.** It is well-known that certain finite element spaces are not *stable* for the Navier–Stokes equations, or even for the simpler Stokes equations. The prime example of an unstable pair of finite element spaces is to use first degree continuous piecewise polynomials for both the velocity and the pressure. Using an unstable pair of spaces typically results in a solution with *spurious* (unwanted, non-physical) oscillations in the pressure solution. The simple remedy is to use continuous piecewise quadratic elements for the velocity and continuous piecewise linear elements for the pressure. Together, these elements form the so-called *Taylor-Hood* element. Spurious oscillations may occur also for splitting methods if an unstable element pair is used."
